# E-bot 
This is the repo for my discord bot: E-Bot

My friends and I add fun features to him and when we get tired of them we remove them.



To run, Run discord_bot.py
## Current behavior:
Jukebox - lets users add and manage a queue of audiofiles to play. Our sound library consists of over 700 short audio clips. Many are random sound bytes from gamefiles, memes, songs, and some custom sounds I designed. I've been building out the library slowly over 4 years.
Admin - moderator commands.




## Depreciated behavior:
- textbased dungeon crawler that runs in a discord text chat. originally created to run on an arduino uno in c. ported it to python. any user can have a go at completing the game in discord.
  - later added twitch support to 

- Integration with twitch chat that allows twitch chatters control some of e-bot's behavior.
  - Like twitch chatters can tell ebot to insult someone in the discord server and the bot will generate an insult.
  - a twitch plays king of the hill game that chatters can play. Input a direction and a force. Then users can try to bump eachother off the ring. the bot tracks user behavior. Leaderboard for kills. Accolades for multi-kills. The discord bot will play halo doublekill, triplekill, etc. depending on the highest accolate a chatter recieves.
- Joke behavior known as: the daily bozo. bot picks a random servermember and gives them access to a special bozo_chat channel that only the bozo may access. Only one person can see it at a time and only send 1 message to the channel. Creating a fun, time-limited event that anyone can be apart of. The bozo also gets a one-time use 'bozo react' command. they can reply to anymessage in the server with the command and the bot will add a special bozo emote that nobody in the server can use other than the bot. To inform a friend that their message is silly/funny/dumb etc.
