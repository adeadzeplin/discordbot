# E-bot 
This is the repo for my discord bot: E-Bot

My friends and I add fun features to him and when we get tired of them we remove them.



To run, Run discord_bot.py
## Current behavior:
Jukebox - lets users add and manage a queue of audiofiles to play.
Admin - moderator commands.


## Depreciated behavior:
- textbased dungeon crawler that runs in a discord text chat. originally created to run on an arduino uno in c. ported it to python. any user can have a go at completing the game in discord.
  - later added twitch support to 

- Integration with twitch chat that allows twitch chatters control some of e-bot's behavior.
  - Like twitch chatters can tell ebot to insult someone in the discord server and the bot will generate an insult.
  - a twitch plays king of the hill game that chatters can play. Input a direction and a force. Then users can try to bump eachother off the ring. the bot tracks user behavior. Leaderboard for kills. Accolades for multi-kills. The discord bot will play halo doublekill, triplekill, etc. depending on the highest accolate a chatter recieves.
